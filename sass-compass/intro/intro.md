# Writing stylesheets in the past #

* difficult to sensibly structure files/code (-> multiple HTTP requests)
* lack of tools for code reuse (variables, functions, ...)
* low priortiy ("it's just CSS")
* high hurdles (x-browser compatibility, selector performance)
* incompatible approaches:  
computer science **vs.** design thinking  
"it needs to be DRY & fast" (OOCSS) **vs.** "it needs to be *just right* on every page"
