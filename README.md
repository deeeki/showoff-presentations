This is a repository with Railslove presentations created using [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff)

### How to create a new presentation

First you need to install showoff and all its depencies.

Then you run `showoff create presentationname` within the showoff-presentations directory.

After that you `cd` into your new presentation directory and run `../install_template.sh` which will create symbolic links to the assets in the `/template` folder.

### Start showoff presentation server
run `showoff serve`

### Use Raillove styles in your slides
You can assign each slide different style and style combinations.

Available styles are:

* opener: First slide with Raillove logo (any content is hidden)
[<img src="raw/master/template/readme-images/opener.png">](raw/master/template/readme-images/opener.png)
* callout:
* chapter-opener
* full-page-image
