Get out of the trap!

Ralph von der Heyden, Georg Leciejewski and Jan Kus

In our talk we share some of the most interesting, absurd, or funny insights
and moments we experienced in our past couple of years. As developers and
business founders, we present the best of our own mistakes and show you how we
got out of the pits we fell into. Believe us, weâ€™ve been there as well and,
hopefully, attending our talk will help you not making the mistakes we already
made for you ;) It will be serious fun! The talk will cover both technical and
other subjects.
