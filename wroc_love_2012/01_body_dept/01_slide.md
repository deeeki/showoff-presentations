# Stressful projects

* Stressing out the body, b/c of customer complaints, deadlines etc.
* Be open, be realistic, don't over-promise and under-deliver
* Avoid customers that stress you out, there are plenty of other jobs/customers
* Don't put more work in a week than your body can take
* If you have to stress you out for some days or even weeks:
  * Reserve more time for recovery
  * e.g. fewer tickets for the next sprint
* Will help against burn out and you will think about your work in a positive way

# Sleep RIGHT

It's your PALIWO

<!-- !SLIDE 

# Sleep right

* Sleep is needed for recovery
* Sometimes we wake up full of energy, sometimes not. Why?
  * Determine if you are a lark or an owl: What time would you get up and go to sleep if you were entirely free to plan your day?
  * Lark: Wake at 6am, sleep at 9 to 10 pm
  * Owl: Wake at 8 to 9 am, go to bet at midnight or 1 am
* Stick to your sleep cycle (Wakemate etc.)

# Reguraly take a
Nap

<!-- !SLIDE 

# A Nap

* Mammals are programmed for 2 periods of intense sleepiness
* Consolidating sleep in 1 large sleepiness is not as recovering as 2 periods
* Short naps can help
  * Lark: 1 or 1:30 pm
  * Owl: 2:30 or 3 pm
* You cannot work "full steam" during your midday wave of drowsiness
* So you can as well take a nap
* Ideal length: 20 (light sleep) to 45 (including REM) minutes
* Eye shades to protect your eyes from light
* Headphones with white noise agains noise
* Enjoy the energy boost after the nap
