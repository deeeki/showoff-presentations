Rails Asset Pipeline
====================


!SLIDE
Uses Sprockets to
=================
1. concatenate assets
2. minify assets
3. compile SASS/SCSS and CoffeeScript


!SLIDE bullets incremental
-vs- :cache => true
===================
* :cache couldn't create caches in advance
* AP minifies assets
* AP inserts an MD5 fingerprint into the filename instead of :cache's query strings


!SLIDE bullets incremental
Folder Structure
================
* /app/assets
  - your app's assets
    + images
    + stylesheets
    + javascripts
* /vendor/assets
  - external libraries
* /lib/assets
  - your own libraries


!SLIDE bullets incremental
Manifest Files
==============
* define what files are bundled up and in what order
* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css(.sass/.scss)<br>app/assets/javascript/application.js(.coffee)
* must be included in layout with the usual stylesheet\_link\_tag or javascript\_include\_tag


!SLIDE bullets incremental
Requires
========
* \#= require base
* //= require_directory ../../../vendor/stylesheets/jQuery-UI
* //= require_tree .
* //= require_self
<br><br>
* Compass: use @import instead of //= require


!SLIDE
Paths & URL Helpers
===================
* SASS: image-url('logo.png') -> '/assets/logo.png'
* Views: image_tag 'logo.png'


!SLIDE
Limitations
===========

    @@@ Ruby
    # AP does not support IE conditionals (\<!--[if lt IE 9]\>)
    # to process a single file with the AP add this to production.rb:
    config.assets.precompile += %w(ie.css)
* AP suggests to have same bundle of assets on all pages
* cannot exclude assets (âˆ„ //= dont_require)
* Compass renders require_tree useless =(


!SLIDE bullets incremental
Production -vs- Development Mode
================================
    @@@ Ruby
    config.assets.compress = true # (false in development)
    config.assets.debug = false # (true in development)
    
    # Don't fall back to assets pipeline if a
    # precompiled asset is missing
    config.assets.compile = false # (true in development)


!SLIDE bullets incremental
On Heroku
=========
* use Cedar stack
* 3 options:
  1. Compile assets locally
  2. Compile assets during slug compilation
  3. Compile assets during runtime
* no access to initialiser variables during 2.
* e.g. active_admin needs sass-rails outside the Gemfile's :assets group
